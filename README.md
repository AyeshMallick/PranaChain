Pranachain — AI & Blockchain in Healthcare

🚀 Status: Planning Phase | 📅 Fall 2025

Pranachain is an academic–industry initiative exploring how Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain can be combined to transform healthcare data management and predictive analytics.

The vision is simple:

Patients keep ownership and control of their health records.

AI models provide early insights into conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease.

A blockchain-backed ledger ensures transparency, trust, and tamper-proof logging of predictions.

🌍 Why this matters

Healthcare data is often siloed, insecure, and inaccessible to the people who need it most — patients and practitioners. Pranachain aims to:

Improve data integrity and privacy

Enable trustworthy AI-driven predictions

Provide a transparent, auditable trail of clinical insights

🎯 Project Goals

Predictive Models

Explore machine learning for key health risks (diabetes, heart disease, chronic conditions).

Blockchain Ledger

Prototype a lightweight blockchain demo to log AI predictions securely.

Roadmap & Evaluation

Define metrics, compare approaches, and publish implementation pathways.

Community Impact

Highlight the role of AI and blockchain in patient empowerment.

📂 Planned Repository Structure

docs/ — project briefs, problem definition, data sources, ethics notes

plans/ — milestones, timeline, risk management, contributions

notebooks/ — future experiments (data exploration, modeling)

src/ — utilities, helper scripts (to be added later)

reports/ — deliverables (technical report, presentation)

README.md — this file

🛠 Current Phase

We are in the planning and research stage:

Problem definition

Dataset identification

Literature review

Experiment design

No code has been committed yet — but this repository is the foundation for all future work.

📅 Roadmap (High-Level)

Week 1–2: Define scope, gather datasets, review literature

Week 3–4: Initial data exploration, baseline models

Week 5–6: Blockchain logging demo + refined AI models

Final Weeks: Integration, report, presentation
